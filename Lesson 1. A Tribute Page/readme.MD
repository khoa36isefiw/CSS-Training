## A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. 
We will add an image of him at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, we will write a few of his achievements and details. We will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and beautify the design. 

### Approach:

- In the <body> element, we will give the title of the page using h1 tag
- after that we will add an image of him in the img tag with some caption.
- We will create another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags).
- We have also given ID for each tag so that we can beautify the design using respective-ID in the CSS file.
In the CSS section we have basically maintained a central design and used box-shadow to create box effect around the main content.
